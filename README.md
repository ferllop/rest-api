# Almighty simple rest api

A small library to have a response from a given endpoint.

It is made to be used in the middle of an http request and an http response, so you can use whether http server that you want.

There is a working example inside the xamples directory.

It has dependencies as git submodules so you can clone the project and its submodules adding --recursive to the clone command:

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ferllop/rest-api.git
```
